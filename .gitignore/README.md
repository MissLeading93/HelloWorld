# HelloWorld
To anyone whom may actually access:
I'm using Github to store practice codes and project ideas I'll be working on for the duration. In this repository I'll be programing an Arduino One and Raspberry Pi 3B to take in sensor information such as humidity, rain, temp, etc..
It'll be in Python.
